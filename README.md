# LSPACMAN

## INTRODUCTION

In this practice as the title of the same explains, the most famous game of the 80s, Pacman, will have to be implemented.
 
As is known to most Pacman is a video game that consists of going through a maze with our character, a charismatic yellow circle with a triangular mouth, in order to take as many prizes as possible while you have to escape from your enemies, Ghosts, which every time they play our player, will remain one of the three lives we have in order to achieve our highest score.

In order to reach as many points as we can we will have to collect the previously mentioned prizes, of which we have two types:
 
  - The smallest and most abundant, who will add us 10 points to our box.
  - The largest and the smallest, which will allow us to add 40 points.
 
Our enemies, the ghosts, will try to prevent us from achieving our goal of collecting as many fruits as we can and in order to do so they will have a totally random movement unlike the original game, in which they did not have a random movement; we were going to the pacman
 
The implementation that we will carry out will not only be based on playing a simple game, but we will have an initial menu where we will have the option to start a new game or load a previously saved to continue from where we had left last time So, if we could not finish our game for any reason, we can resume it whenever we want to enter the name of the game.
 
When we select the first option "Start new game" we will have to enter three fields:
 
- Game name - Player name - Do you want to load default map? <s / n>
 
The name of the game will serve as explained above, in order to load your game where you left it.
 
The name of the player will be useful for us to be reflected if our name appears in the 5 best players that played in our Pacman. So, if this is the case, we will see in what position we are and how many points we have and the rest of the players, in the lower right corner of the game box.
 
The third and last option gives us the right to choose which map we want to play. If we enter the "s" option, it will mean that we are accessing a previously preloaded map that will be the default map of the game. On the other hand, if we choose the "n" option, we can enter the name of the map we want to load to play as long as it meets the established parameters.
